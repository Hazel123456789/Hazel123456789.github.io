            <h2>Breaking News: Local Hobo Protests Slugs in the Sewers of Leyndell!</h2>
            <p>Local sewer hobo Morgott the Omen King has been sending repeated angry letters to the mayor of Leyndell, stating that the slugs which were recently introduced to the sewers in an effort to combat the rampant crayfish problem have banded together and waged war on the local rats. Both Mayor Rogier and the Rat King declined to be interviewed, but Morgott had plenty to say on the matter.</p>
            <p>"I've had it with these varmints stinking up my house! So what if the slugs were thrown down here to deal with the crayfish, at least I can eat the crayfish! But I can't eat a slug, and they're making too much noise by fighting those rats! I can't even fall asleep at night because those gosh darn slugs keep shooting their AK-47s at the rats. The least [Rogier] could do is take away their little toys so they'd have nothing to fight each other with. But noooo, they're integral to cleaning up the city, apparently! It was clean enough before they got here. Now it's just a mess."</p>

            <h2>Slug Populations Recovering From the GreaseBlight:</h2>
            <p>As we all know, the GreaseBlight of 1782 B.C. destroyed many key slug habitats across Eurasia. But now, thousands of years later, thanks to human intervention, the slug populations have started to return to the forests, volcanoes, and drainpipes they once called home. We interviewed slug expert Radagon Redmane on the subject.</p>

                <p>When asked what it was doing behind the bakery, the slug didn't have too much to say. It simply grunted and slowly became one with the pavement. How rude.</p>

                <p>The slug was delighted to answer any questions regarding its line of work: "Well, you see i'm looking for any fossilized mushrooms on the inside of this drainpipe. Lots of mushrooms have been growing in and around the Sears tower ever since it phased into existence back in 50,000 BCE, so there's a good chance some of them have fossilized on the inside of this drainpipe."</p>

Eyewitnesses report the entity as being "slightly-green, but also not green at all", while others claim that it was blue. In truth, this was likely just a prank conducted by the local Bank Robbers' Club.</p>
